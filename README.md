# Antilope 

Antilope is a client project I have to make as part of my bachelor in web/multimedia at HEPL, a school in Belgium.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).
3. Create the database (PhpMyAdmin, Adminer, SequelPro, ...).
4. Configure the site and the database access in the `wp-config.php` file. (If it doesn't exist, create it based on the content from `wp-config-sample.php`).
5. Import the file `database.sql`.
6. Run `npm install`.

## Plugins to install
